In this piece, two butterfly images serve as the base textures, with one butterfly's vibration controlled by an audio track. A feedback loop is then used to create rotational patterns through rotation and addition. Finally, Mirror and Tile effects are applied to form a complex composition.

                    This effect was achieved using multiple nodes. First, circles with varying sizes and shapes were used as masks to extract parts of the background video. Then, an RGB Delay was applied to create a dreamy effect. A constantly changing point cloud was generated using Noise, and finally, a contrasting background color was added to complete the composition.
