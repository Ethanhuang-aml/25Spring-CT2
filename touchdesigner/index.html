                    This is a motion-controlled game. Players use both hands to individually control the airplane's two wings.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p2">
                    Game Rules:
                    The faster and wider the player swings both hands, the more upward and forward force is generated by the wings.
                    By creating a difference in the force applied to each wing, the player can steer the airplane in different directions.

                Coin: When the airplane collides with a coin's collider, the coin disappears.

                GameManager: Manages the scoring system — each time a coin is collected, the score in the top-left corner of the screen increases by one.

            <p class="p2">
                PlaneController: The core script of the game. Each wing of the airplane has an empty object that provides upward lift and forward thrust when triggered. Additionally, there is another empty object at the nose of the plane that provides balancing force to counteract the lift from the rear and prevent the plane from flipping. This script also includes a module to adjust the airplane's center of gravity.

                SensorInputController: Used to control the airplane based on input from the hardware in later stages.

                During the test where the plane is controlled via the keyboard, everything worked smoothly. The plane could fly properly using the "A" and "L" keys. Everything is ready for hardware integration.

            <p class="p2">
                After purchasing and assembling two distance sensors, it was discovered that they could not effectively transmit data. Due to some fixed internal configurations of the sensors, interface issues occurred, making them unusable.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                The distance sensor was replaced, but it was found to operate at 5V. Therefore, the main board was also replaced with an Arduino Uno, which supports 5V operation. After testing, everything worked fine, and the sensor can now be integrated into Unity.

                Test in Unity whether sensor data can be received. The test shows that adjustments are still needed for the planecontroller, as precise control is currently not achievable.

                <p class="p2">
                    Through multiple adjustments, such as the plane's pitch angle, the amount of forward and upward force generated by each hand movement, and the position of the plane's center of gravity, precise control of the airplane was eventually achieved.
