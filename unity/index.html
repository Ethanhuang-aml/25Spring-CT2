                    I have created an assisted reproduction device, which exists fifty years into the future. In that era, people live in a democratic society, and with the emergence of this device, they are more willing to have children.

                  <p>
                    The core function of this device is to accelerate the reproduction process, reducing the typical ten-month gestation period to five months, significantly alleviating the burden on pregnant individuals.

                    Its mechanism relies on a continuous supply of heat and nutritional supplements, while also monitoring the fetus's health in real-time. Additionally, some corporations have marketed it as a fashionable accessory, incorporating various design elements into its appearance, further boosting its popularity and sales.

                Describtion: I initially designed my coordinate system with the x-axis representing reproduction through humans or machines, and the y-axis representing monarchic rule versus democracy. The overview of the future envisioned in each quadrant is written in the diagram. The archeology I want to create belongs to the fourth quadrant, as I find it to have a fascinating tension: it depicts a democratic society, yet at the same time, humans must rely on machines to reproduce an increasing number of people.

                Describtion: In the second version of the coordinate system, I modified the x-axis to focus more on the driving forces behind reproduction. One side represents voluntary reproduction, while the other represents forced reproduction. Once again, I chose the fourth quadrant, where people use technological means to actively choose reproduction.
