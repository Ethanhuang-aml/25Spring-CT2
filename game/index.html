                    This is a motion-controlled game. Players use both hands to individually control the airplane's two wings.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p2">
                    Game Rules:
                    The faster and wider the player swings both hands, the more upward and forward force is generated by the wings.
                    By creating a difference in the force applied to each wing, the player can steer the airplane in different directions.

                    In modeling the snowy mountain, I first reshaped the terrain, then applied a marble texture across the entire surface. Next, I painted a snow texture on the top, followed by a soil texture at the base of the mountain. Finally, I added patches of grass texture to create smooth transitions between the different layers.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                The volcano model was created using the same method. The difference lies in that the entire volcano is composed of a marble texture. Additionally, various bumps and depressions were sculpted on the surface to enhance realism and better accommodate the lava that would be added later.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                The construction of the meadow was relatively simple due to its less complex terrain. I painted it using soil and various grass textures, and added more grass models to enhance the overall detail.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                By altering the shape of the terrain, I created a waterfall and a lake, preparing them for the addition of water materials later on.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                I found a suitable water model on the Unity Asset Store (the lava was also sourced from there) and adjusted the terrain's elevation details to ensure a seamless fit between the terrain and the water.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                Selected tree trunk models were added to the small hills around the waterfall and lake, enhancing the scene with a more eerie and dreamlike atmosphere.

            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                The lava model was trimmed and scaled according to the shape of the volcano to ensure a perfect fit. Additionally, suitable lava rock models were placed at the base of the volcano to enhance the level of detail.

            <p class="p2">
                Finally, I selected a suitable HDRI image from the Poliigon website. I chose a Jupiter-themed background to place the entire scene in outer space, giving it a more magical and surreal atmosphere.
